## Plant Babies
![plantBaby](plantBaby.jpg)

I am REALLY bad at keeping plants alive. I killed a cactus by forgetting to water it once... 

These plant babies sit in the soil of your potted plants and cry like a real baby when they need water (reminding you not to kill them)!

## Tamagotchi mode

Oh, I also made an app for them so you can turn on "tamagotchi" mode and check out all your plants stats!
